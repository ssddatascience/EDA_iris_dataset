Project Title

  Irish Dataset Analysis

Project Description
  The iris dataset is a well-known and frequently used dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains information about the physical characteristics of different species of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis of the iris dataset and to gain insights into the relationships between these variables.

Data
  The iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of three different species of iris: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample contains the       following four attributes:

  Sepal length in centimeters
  Sepal width in centimeters
  Petal length in centimeters
  Petal width in centimeters
  
Methodology
  The analysis of the iris dataset will include several steps, including data cleaning and preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and data visualization. Some of the       techniques that will be used in this project include:

    Scatter plots
    Histograms
    Box plots
    Correlation analysis
    
Results
    The analysis of the iris dataset is expected to yield several interesting insights, including:
    The relationships between the different attributes of the iris flowers, including the correlations between sepal length and width, and between petal length and         width   
    The differences between the physical characteristics of the different species of iris flowers, including differences in the size and shape of their petals and         sepals Any outliers or anomalies in the data that may indicate errors or unusual observations
    
Conclusion:

    The results of this analysis will provide valuable information about the relationships between the different attributes of the iris dataset and will help to gain a     better understanding of the physical characteristics of the different species of iris flowers. This information can be used to make predictions about new data and     to identify patterns and trends in other datasets.
